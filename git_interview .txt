git revert <commit> creates a new commit that undoes changes from a specified commit.
git reset <commit> resets the current branch to a specified commit, optionally modifying the index and working directory.
What is git stash and how is it used?

git stash temporarily saves changes in a dirty working directory without committing them, allowing you to work on something else before returning to the stashed changes with git stash apply.
Explain the difference between git reset and git revert.

git reset moves the current branch head and can modify the staging index and working directory.
git revert creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit, preserving the project history.
What is a Git hook?

Git hooks are scripts that run automatically on specific events in the Git lifecycle, such as before committing or pushing.
Git Collaboration and Workflow Questions
What is a pull request?

A pull request is a way to propose changes to a repository, allowing others to review, discuss, and merge the changes.
How do you handle large files in Git?

Use Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage large files by replacing them with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server.
What are some best practices for using Git?

Basic Git Interview Questions and Answers
1. What is Git?
Git is a decentralized version control system engineered for rapid and effective management of projects ranging from modest to vast in scale. It supports collaborative efforts among developers by monitoring file modifications and enhancing teamwork.

2. What is a repository in Git?
A Git repository is a location where your project resides, acting as a storage area. This repository can exist locally within a directory on your computer or on a cloud-based platform like GitHub. It encompasses all the files associated with the project, along with a record of the modifications made to these files over time.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a tool for version control that enables you to monitor and record the evolution of your source code. GitHub is an online hosting service that facilitates the management of Git repositories. GitHub offers a user-friendly web interface along with functionalities such as permission management, task organization, error tracking, and the capability to handle feature suggestions.

4. How does Git work?
Git works by taking snapshots of a project's files. Unlike other version control systems, Git records the entire contents of each file and its changes every time a commit is made. This makes operations like branching, merging, and reverting changes more efficient.

5. What is a commit in Git?
In Git, a commit is a process that records a version of the project's presently prepared modifications. This record includes details on the modifications implemented, a distinctive identifier (a SHA-1 hash), the creator's identity, and the timestamp of the commit.

6. What is branching in Git?
In Git, branching allows you to veer off from the primary development path and proceed with separate tasks without impacting the main workflow. This technique enables the isolated development of features, bug fixes, or experimentation within a specific section of the repository, ensuring that each process remains distinct from the others.

7. What is a merge in Git?
Merging is a Git operation that integrates changes from one branch into another. It can be a fast-forward merge, where the target branch is updated to the latest commit of the source branch, or a three-way merge, where divergent branch histories are combined into a new commit.

8. What is a conflict in Git?
A conflict in Git occurs when two branches have made edits to the same line in a file or when one branch deletes a file while the other branch modifies it. Git cannot automatically resolve these changes; the developer must manually resolve the conflicts.

9. What is a pull request?
A pull request serves as a mechanism for contributing to a project, typically utilized in projects hosted on GitHub. In this process, a developer implements modifications within their own branch, uploads these changes to a repository, and then initiates a pull request. This action prompts the project's maintainers to examine the proposed changes, engage in discussions about possible adjustments, and ultimately integrate the pull request into the primary branch.

10. What is `git fetch` vs. `git pull`?
`git fetch` downloads updates from a remote repository to your local repository without integrating them. On the other hand, `git pull` not only fetches the updates but also incorporates them into your active branch.

11. How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed and made public?
To undo the modifications introduced by a previous commit while ensuring safety for public commits, employ `git revert <commit_hash>`, which generates a fresh commit that reverses the earlier changes. On the other hand, `git reset` allows reverting to an earlier state; however, exercise caution when applying it to public commits, as it alters the commit history.

12. What is a `.gitignore` file?
A `.gitignore` file is a textual document instructing Git on the files or directories to exclude from a project. This commonly encompasses files created during the build phase, local setup files, or files with confidential data.

13. How do you clone a repository?
To create a local copy of a repository on your machine, execute the command `git clone <repository_url>`. This action duplicates the repository locally.

14. What is `git stash`?
The `git stash` command temporarily stores your working directory's modifications, allowing you to switch branches without discarding your current progress.

15. How do you view the commit history?
Use `git log` to view the commit history. There are many options to customize the output, such as `git log --oneline` for a condensed view.

16. What is a remote in Git?
A Git remote refers to a shared repository utilized by all team members for the purpose of exchanging their updates. Typically, this repository is on a server or a cloud-based hosting service like GitHub.

17. How do you create a new branch?
Use `git branch <branch_name>` to create a new branch. Use `git checkout -b <branch_name>` to create and switch to it in one step.

18. What is `git merge --squash`?
The `git merge --squash` command consolidates all commits from a specified feature branch into a single commit when merging into the target branch, resulting in a tidier project history.

19. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
To resolve a merge conflict, edit the files to fix the conflicting changes. Then, use `git add` to stage the resolved files and `git commit` to commit the resolved merge.

20. What is `git rebase`?
`git rebase` transfers modifications from one branch to another, enabling the creation of a streamlined project timeline by relocating the updates of a feature branch to the forefront of the main branch.

21. What is the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?
The main difference is in how the branch history is presented. `git merge` preserves the history of a feature branch by creating a new merge commit. `git rebase` rewrites the feature branch's history to appear as if it was developed from the latest main branch, creating a linear history.

22. How do you change the last commit?
Use `git commit --amend` to modify the most recent commit. This can change the commit's message or include new changes.

23. What is `git push`?
`git push` is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. It transfers commits from your local repo to the remote.

24. How do you delete a branch?
Use `git branch -d <branch_name>` to delete a local branch. If the branch is not fully merged, you may need to use `-D` instead. To delete a remote branch, use `git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>`.

25. What is `git checkout`?
`git checkout` allows navigating between different branches or reverting working tree files to a previous state. However, in the latest versions of Git, it is advised to use `git switch` for changing branches and `git restore` to revert files, each designated for these specific functions.

Use `git add <file_name>` to add a file to the staging area, making it ready for a commit.

28. How do you remove a file from Git but not delete it from your file system?
Use `git rm --cached <file_name>` to remove a file from Git without deleting it from your filesystem.

29. What is `git diff`?
`git diff` shows the differences between files in the working directory and the index, or between commits.

30. How do you rename a Git branch?
To rename the current branch, use `git branch -m <new_name>`. To rename a different branch, use `git branch -m <old_name> <new_name>`.

31. What does `git reset` do?
`git reset` is used to undo changes. It has three main modes: `--soft`, `--mixed`, and `--hard`.

32. How do you amend a commit message?
Use `git commit --amend` to change your most recent commit message.

33. What is the HEAD in Git?
HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch.

34. How do you find a commit by a message?
Use `git log --grep=<search-pattern>` to search through commit messages.

35. What is the difference between `git stash pop` and `git stash apply`?
`git stash pop` applies stashed changes and removes them from the stash. `git stash apply` applies stashed changes but keeps them in the stash.

36. How do you list all branches that contain a specific commit?
Use `git branch --contains <commit>`.

37. What is a fast-forward merge in Git?
A fast-forward merge happens when the target branch's tip is behind the merged branch's tip, allowing the target branch to "catch up" by just moving forward to the merged branch's tip.

38. How do you create an empty commit?
Use `git commit --allow-empty` to create a commit with no changes.

39. How do you switch branches in Git?
Use `git checkout <branch-name>` to switch branches.

40. How do you ignore changes in a tracked file?
Use `git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>` to ignore changes in a tracked file temporarily.

Advanced Git Interview Questions and Answers
1. What is the Git object model?
The Git object model consists of blobs (representing file data), trees (which organize the file structure), commits (which record the changes), and tags (which mark specific points in history).

2. Explain the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase` and when you would use each.
`git merge` integrates changes from one branch to another, preserving the history of both branches. `git rebase` rewrites the history by placing commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history. Use `merge` to preserve the history of a feature branch, and `rebase` to clean up the commit history before merging.

3. How does Git store data?
Git preserves project data by taking snapshots at various points in time. Every commit acts as a record of the files' condition at that specific instance. To manage this information effectively, Git employs both delta compression and the use of direct object references.

4. What is the role of the `.git/index` file?
The `.git/index` file acts as the staging area (or index) for Git. It tracks which changes are staged for the next commit.

5. Explain what a "detached HEAD" is and how you might end up in one.
A detached HEAD occurs when you check out a specific commit rather than a branch. This temporary state allows you to navigate through the history of the repository without making changes to the branches.

6. How do you interactively rebase the last N commits?
Use `git rebase -i HEAD~N` where N is the number of commits you want to rebase. This opens an editor showing the last N commits and allows you to reorder, squash, edit, or drop commits.

7. What are the advantages of using a rebase over a merge?
Rebase creates a cleaner, linear commit history, which can simplify the understanding and exploration of project history. It avoids unnecessary merge commits and can make the history easier to navigate.

8. What is a git hook and how might you use it?
Git hooks are automated scripts triggered before or after specific Git commands, such as pre-commit, pre-push, post-commit, and post-receive, are executed. They serve various functions, including syntax verification, testing, and the enforcement of project guidelines.

9. How do you squash the last N commits into one using Git?
Use `git rebase -i HEAD~N` and mark all but the first commit with "squash" or "fixup" to combine them into a single commit.

10. What is the Git Garbage Collection and when is it called?
Git's garbage collection (`git gc`) is a housekeeping task that cleans up unnecessary files and optimizes the local repository. It is automatically called by certain commands but can be manually triggered for maintenance.

11. How do you find and restore a deleted file in the Git history?
Use `git log -- <file-path>` to find the commit where the file was deleted, then use `git checkout <commit-hash>^ -- <file-path>` to restore it.

12. What is the significance of `git push --force-with-lease` over `git push --force`?
`git push --force-with-lease` ensures that you do not overwrite any work on the remote repository that you haven't seen, unlike `git push --force` which overwrites the remote changes blindly.

13. How can you achieve a Git bisect manually?
Manually performing a bisect involves checking out commits in a binary search manner to narrow down the commit that introduced a bug, but this is automated with `git bisect`.

14. Explain the difference between `git stash pop` and `git stash apply`.
`git stash pop` implements the modifications from the most recent stash and then deletes it from the stash inventory, while `git stash apply` enacts the changes yet preserves them within the stash inventory.

15. How do you reapply a commit that has been reverted?
Use `git revert <commit-hash>` to revert the revert commit, effectively reapplying the original commit.

16. What is the purpose of `git cherry-pick`?
`git cherry-pick` is used to apply the changes introduced by some commits from one branch onto another branch.

17. How do you resolve a binary file conflict in Git?
Binary file conflicts must be resolved manually by choosing which version of the file to keep, then adding and committing that file.

18. What is the function of `git blame -L`?
`git blame -L` shows who last modified each line of a file within a given line range.

19. How do you handle large files with Git?
Use Git Large File Storage (LFS) to handle large files by storing references in the repository but keeping the actual files on a separate server.

20. What is the use of `git submodule` and how do you update one?
Git submodules enable you to maintain a Git repository as a subdirectory within a different Git repository. To update a submodule, use the command `git submodule update --remote`.

21. How do you list all the aliases you have set in Git?
Use `git config --get-regexp alias` to list all aliases set in the Git configuration.

22. Explain how to change the base branch of a pull request.
Modifying the base branch of a pull request usually requires altering the target branch through the pull request interface provided by a Git hosting platform (such as GitHub or GitLab).

23. What does `git reflog` show and how can it be useful?
`git reflog` shows a log of the changes to the local repository's HEAD. It can be useful for recovering lost commits or exploring changes made to branches.

24. How do you integrate changes from a remote branch without a merge commit?
Use `git pull --rebase` to rebase the current branch on top of the remote branch, integrating changes without a merge commit.

25. What is a symbolic reference in Git?
A symbolic reference is a reference to another reference, such as a branch name being a reference to a commit. The HEAD is a common example of a symbolic reference.

26. How do you find which commit a bug was introduced in?
Use `git bisect` to perform a binary search through the commit history to find the commit that introduced a bug.

27. What is the purpose of `git worktree`?
`git worktree` allows you to have multiple working trees attached to the same repository, enabling you to work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching the current worktree.

28. How do you configure Git to use a proxy?
Configure Git to use a proxy by setting the `http.proxy` or `https.proxy` configuration, for example, `git config --global http.proxy proxy-url`.

29. What is the difference between a shallow clone and a deep clone in Git?
A shallow clone (`git clone --depth 1`) creates a copy of the repository with a limited history depth, reducing time and space, whereas a deep clone includes the complete history.

30. How do you amend the author of a previous commit?
Use `git commit --amend --author="New Author Name <email@domain.com>"` to change the author of the most recent commit, or use an interactive rebase for older commits.

31. What is the purpose of `git fsck` and how do you use it?
`git fsck` (file system check) is used to verify the integrity of the Git file system, checking for corrupt objects.

32. How do you create a patch with Git?
Use `git diff > patch_name.patch` to create a patch file with the changes between commits or branches.

33. What is the use of `git revert --no-commit`?
`git revert --no-commit` reverts the changes made by one or more commits without committing the revert, allowing you to make additional changes before committing.

34. How do you implement a Git workflow in a team environment?
Implement a Git workflow by establishing a branching model (like Git Flow or GitHub Flow), setting up a code review process, defining commit message guidelines, and integrating CI/CD pipelines.

35. What are Git hooks and how can they be customized for a project?
Git hooks are executable scripts triggered by Git prior to or following events like commits, pushes, and receptions. These scripts can be tailored by placing them in the `.git/hooks` directory.

36. How do you troubleshoot connectivity issues when using Git with a remote repository?
Troubleshoot connectivity issues by checking network connections, verifying remote repository URLs, ensuring authentication credentials are correct, and reviewing proxy configurations.

37. What is the significance of the `git fetch --tags` command?
`git fetch --tags` fetches all tags from the remote repository, updating your local tag references.

38. How can you use Git to track changes in any file, even if it's not code?
Git can track changes in any file type (binary or text) by adding the file to the repository and committing changes. For binary files, it's often beneficial to use Git LFS.

39. Explain the process of contributing to an open-source project using Git.
Contributing to an open-source project typically involves forking the project repository, cloning your fork, making changes in a new branch, pushing the branch to your fork, and submitting a pull request to the original repository.

40. How do you manage multiple configurations for different projects in Git?
Manage multiple configurations by using the `git config` command with the `--global`, `--system`, or `--local` flags to set configuration options at different levels or by using includeIf in the Git configuration to include specific configurations based on the repository path.
